A small JQuery based app using JSON to pull 10 most relevant photos for a user defined location from the Flicker API.
For understandable reasons I have deleted my flickr API key. In order for the app to work, add your API key at line 41.
Code is free to be stolen/reimplemented/ fiddled with in any way possible. I do not take any responsibility for its actions ;p
